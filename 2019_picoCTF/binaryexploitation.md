### Description
> You're going to need to know how to run programs if you're going to get out of here. Navigate to /problems/practice-run-1_0_62b61488e896645ebff9b6c97d0e775e on the shell server and run this program to receive a flag.

### Solution: 
Absolute newbie here, so dot slash (./) is used in Linux/Unix to execute a compiled program in the current directory. Do so for the program found called `run_this`.
```
$ cd /problems/practice-run-1_0_62b61488e896645ebff9b6c97d0e775e
$ ./run_this
```
Flag is `picoCTF{g3t_r3ady_2_r3v3r53}`
